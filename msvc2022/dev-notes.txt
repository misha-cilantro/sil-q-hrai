TODO:

- Write elven res to character sheet (below dungeon pressure)
- Adjust score by elven res count
- Ask to turn on floor res
- Floor res
- Write floor res to score

---

for menu stuff look at birth.c

static bool get_ahw(void) in birth.c

is a good reference for querying and showing stuff

!!!!!
static bool player_birth_aux(void)

is the function that runs all the character setup stuff in order!

--

Death is handled in files.c: close_game(void)

The game loop is in dungeon.c: play_game(bool new_game)


Crash/inf loop is in:
static void fix_player_0(void)

if (p_ptr->depth >= min_depth()) is where the elf rez crash/loop happens
also we probably should reset the turn to 0?

--

p_ptr = the player pointer

--

globals need to be placed in the externs.h file.

Desired features:

- Adjust final score by:
  * dungeon pressure (divide the same as in min depth, 1 = 1/5)
  * divide by number of elven resurrections
  * divide by number of floor res * 3

- Write to character sheet:
  * number of elven res OR number of floor res (since floor res turns off elven res)

- For the two elf races, allow resurrection on death. Start back at floor 0, with all experience but all items lost. (Mandos save.)
  

- Restart floor on death. (Easy save.)
  * actually would be MUCH easier to restart on a new floor, so will probably
    just do that!
