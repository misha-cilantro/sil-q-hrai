for menu stuff look at birth.c

static bool get_ahw(void) in birth.c

is a good reference for querying and showing stuff

!!!!!
static bool player_birth_aux(void)

is the function that runs all the character setup stuff in order!

--

Death is handled in files.c: close_game(void)

The game loop is in dungeon.c: play_game(bool new_game)

We can cheat death at 3156, just like wizard mode, for both types
of cheating.

msg_print("You invoke wizard mode and cheat death.");
message_flush();

--

Inventory dropping handled in object2.c: void inven_drop(int item, int amt) 

Or use item destruction cmd3.c: void do_cmd_destroy(void)

--

p_ptr = the player pointer

--

globals need to be placed in the externs.h file.

Desired features:

- Adjust final score by:
  * dungeon pressure (divide the same as in min depth, 1 = 1/5)
  * divide by number of elven resurrections
  * divide by number of floor res * 3

- Write to character sheet:
  * number of elven res OR number of floor res (since floor res turns off elven res)

- For the two elf races, allow resurrection on death. Start back at floor 0, with all experience but all items lost. (Mandos save.)
  

- Restart floor on death. (Easy save.)
