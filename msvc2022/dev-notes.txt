for menu stuff look at birth.c

static bool get_ahw(void) in birth.c

is a good reference for querying and showing stuff

!!!!!
static bool player_birth_aux(void)

is the function that runs all the character setup stuff in order!

Death is handled in files.c: close_game(void)

The game loop is in dungeon.c: play_game(bool new_game)

We can cheat death at 3156, just like wizard mode, for both types
of cheating.

msg_print("You invoke wizard mode and cheat death.");
message_flush();

p_ptr = the player pointer

Desired features:

- For the two elf races, allow resurrection on death. Start back at floor 0, with all experience but all items lost. (Mandos save.)

- Restart floor on death. (Easy save.)
